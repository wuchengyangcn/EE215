# Systematic Evaluation & Optimization in Manufacturing Scenarios
+ generic algorithm: Implement *Genetic Algorithm* to solve the NP hard *Knapsack Problem*
+ calibration: Combine *Genetic Algorithm* with *Spline Fitting* to reduce the calibration cost for nonlinear measurement equipment in massive manufacturing.
+ sonar: Implement *Monte Carlo method* for simulating *Markov Chain* to assess reliability of clock synchronization in a multi-node SONAR system and carry out system optimization.
+ rs485: Propose a *Finite State Machine* model for evaluating the reliability of a RS485 repairable multi-agent communication system and assess performance improvement of three engineering solutions.
